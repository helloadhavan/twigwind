Twigwind is a small experiment in creating a utility-first CSS framework. The idea began while experimenting with the `document.querySelectorAll()` function. Many CSS frameworks, such as Tailwind, rely on statically generated CSS files with thousands of pre-built classes, later optimized through a purge process. Twigwind takes a different approach, envisioning a compiler-like engine that processes an HTML file and dynamically generates classes to support just-in-time (JIT) compilation and custom class support.

This project is in its early stages, being only a few months old, and is intended to explore new ideas and learnings in lightweight CSS frameworks.

## Who Is It For?
Twigwind might be interesting for:

- Anyone exploring alternative approaches to CSS frameworks
- Developers interested in just-in-time (JIT) class generation
- Those curious about integrating JavaScript with CSS utility frameworks
